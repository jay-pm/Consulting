### Digital Transformation  
- Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into all areas of a business, fundamentally changing how you operate and deliver value to customers. It's also a cultural change that requires organizations to continually challenge the status quo, experiment, and get comfortable with failure.
- Digital transformation signifies a fundamental shift in the utilization of technology, affecting various operational aspects of the company.

- [] The 3 Cs of digital transformation: 
- curiosity (the best question you can ask is "Why?")
- creativity (Everyone has a seat at the digital transformation table, wear your creative hat)
- critical thinking. (utilize your curiosity to ask questions and then critically think on things. Don’t just take things at face value. Ask questions and dig in)  
The individual doesn’t have to become technical or do something great. They start with these 3 Cs to be empowered.
